#Can import functions from other files using the following:
#   from 'abfunctions' import 'sumfunc'
# imports the 'sumfunc' function from the abfunctions file (this doesnt exist as you cant pull from files containing a hyphen) 

#You can rename functions that you have imported using AS
#e.g.  from examplefile import len as eglength
#This is useful when the function being imported has a similar name to another python function
